## Checks

- closes_at after opens_at

## Freshness

Changes rarely.

## Consumers, and what breaks for each

Scheduling, screens. If the schema changes: a missing clinic hides its doctors' blocks.

## Changing the schema

A new Alembic migration, never an edit to an applied one. A breaking change (rename, drop, new meaning) needs an ADR and a version bump here first.

## Check thresholds

Every check above has a threshold of **0 violations**. Uniqueness and ranges are enforced by the database where possible; the rest by `tests/test_schema.py`, `tests/test_seed.py` and the seed.
